# Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles, I use neovim as my main editor, and alacritty as my terminal.

## Usage
To use these dotfiles, you need to have python3 installed.

On unix-like systems, you can use the following commands to symlink the dotfiles to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hxyulin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
python3 dotfiles.py
```

or 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hxyulin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod u+x dotfiles.py
./dotfiles.py
```

On windows, you need to use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hxyulin/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
python dotfiles.py
```
